The program then displays the converted values with their respective denominations, using the appropriate singular or plural form based on the quantity.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java program (e.g., `javac Main.java`).
2. Run the compiled Java program (e.g., `java Main`).
3. Follow the prompt to enter a random number representing cents.
4. The program will output the converted values in dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

## Example

```plaintext
> java Main
Give me a random number & I'll convert it to change: 453
4 Dollars
1 Quarter
2 Dimes
1 Nickel
3 Pennies
```
In this example, the user inputs 453 cents. The program calculates the equivalent amount as 4 dollars, 1 quarter, 2 dimes, 1 nickel, and 3 pennies.

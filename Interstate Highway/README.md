# Interstate Highway

A Java program that determines the direction and type of an interstate highway based on its number.

## Description

The Interstate Highway program takes a user input for an interstate highway number and analyzes it to determine the direction (north/south or east/west) and the type (primary or auxiliary) of the highway.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java program (e.g., `javac Main.java`).
2. Run the compiled Java program (e.g., `java Main`).
3. Follow the prompt to enter the interstate highway number.
4. The program will output the direction and type of the entered interstate highway number.

## Example

In this example, the user inputs the interstate highway number 95. The program then determines and outputs that I-95 is a primary interstate highway going north/south.

```plaintext
> java Main
Interstate Number: 95
I-95 is primary, going north/south.
```

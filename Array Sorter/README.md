# Array Sorter

A Java program that sorts an array of integers, placing the largest value at the beginning, the smallest value at the end, and arranging the remaining elements in ascending order.

## Description

This program takes an array of integers from the user and sorts it in a unique way. The largest element is placed at the beginning of the array, the smallest element is placed at the end of the array, and the remaining elements are sorted in ascending order. The sorted array is then printed out.

## Usage

- Compile the Java program (e.g., `javac Main.java`).
- Run the compiled Java program (e.g., `java Main`).
- Follow the prompts to enter the array size and elements.
- The program will output the sorted array according to the unique sorting method.

## Example

In this example, the user entered an array size of 5 and the following elements: 12, 8, 3, 20, and 15. The program sorted the array with the largest element (20) at the beginning, the smallest element (3) at the end, and the remaining elements (8, 12, and 15) in ascending order.

```plaintext
> java Main
Array Size: 5
Element 1: 12
Element 2: 8
Element 3: 3
Element 4: 20
Element 5: 15

Sorted Array Output:
20,8,12,15,3
```

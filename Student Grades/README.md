# Student Grades

A Java program that uses HashMap to manage and update students' grades.

## Description

The Student Grades program has a pre-populated HashMap containing the names of students and their corresponding grades. The user can enter a student's name and a new grade for that student. The program then displays the student's original grade, updates the HashMap with the new grade, and displays the updated grade. If the student's name is not found in the HashMap, the program will display an error message.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java program (e.g., `javac StudentGrades.java`).
2. Run the compiled Java program (e.g., `java StudentGrades`).
3. Enter a student's name that exists in the pre-populated HashMap.
4. Enter a new grade for the student.
5. The program will display the student's original grade, update the grade in the HashMap, and display the updated grade.
6. If the student's name is not found, the program will display an error message.

## Example

```plaintext
> java StudentGrades
Harry Rawlins
95.5
Harry Rawlins's original grade: 84.3
Harry Rawlins's new grade: 95.5
```
In this example, the user enters the name "Harry Rawlins" and a new grade of 95.5. The program then displays Harry's original grade (84.3), updates the HashMap with the new grade, and displays the updated grade (95.5).

# Fibonacci

A Java program that generates the Fibonacci sequence for a user-specified number of steps.

## Description

The Fibonacci program takes a user input for the desired number of steps and generates the Fibonacci sequence for that many steps. It then outputs the sequence step-by-step, starting after the first 0 and 1.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java program (e.g., `javac FibonacciSequence.java`).
2. Run the compiled Java program (e.g., `java FibonacciSequence`).
3. Follow the prompt to enter the number of steps you want the Fibonacci sequence to be generated for.
4. The program will output the Fibonacci sequence for the specified number of steps.

## Example

In this example, the user inputs 5 steps. The program then generates and outputs the Fibonacci sequence for 5 steps.

0 + 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 2
1 + 2 = 3
2 + 3 = 5

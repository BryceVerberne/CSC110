# Next Substring

A Java program that finds the next substring of a given string after a specified index.

## Description

The Next Substring program takes three user inputs: a word (inputString), a starting index (startIndex), and a search word (searchStr). The program searches for the search word in the input string starting from the specified index and returns the index of the next occurrence of the search word. If the search word is not found, the program returns -1.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java program (e.g., `javac Main.java`).
2. Run the compiled Java program (e.g., `java Main`).
3. Follow the prompts to enter the word, index, and search word.
4. The program will output the index of the next occurrence of the search word or -1 if not found.

## Example

In this example, the user inputs the word "abracadabra", starting index 3, and the search word "ab". The program then returns the index of the next occurrence of the search word "ab" after index 3, which is 7.

```plaintext
> java Main
Word: abracadabra
Index: 3
Search Word: ab
3
```

# CSC 110AB - Introduction to Computer Science (Java)

Welcome to my CSC110 repository! This repository contains programs from my CSC 110AB course: Introduction to Computer Science (Java), taken at Scottsdale Community College with Professor Jackson.

## Course Description

CSC 110AB is a course designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of computer programming using Java as the primary language. The course covers various topics, including problem-solving, algorithm development, basic data structures, and object-oriented programming concepts. Students learn how to write, test, and debug Java programs and gain experience working with real-world programming scenarios.

Throughout the course, students are exposed to a wide range of programming concepts and are encouraged to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are essential for success in the field of computer science.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains a collection of programs completed during my CSC 110AB course. It demonstrates the application of various concepts learned in the class, including, but not limited to, the following:

- Variables and assignments
- Branches (if statements, switch statements)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Arrays and ArrayLists
- User-defined methods
- Objects & classes
- Memory management
- And more

Throughout the course, I extensively used [ZyBooks](https://www.zybooks.com/) for learning materials and project assignments.

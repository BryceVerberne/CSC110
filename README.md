# CSC 110AB - Introduction to Computer Science (Java)

This repository contains programs and projects from my CSC 110AB Introduction to Computer Science (Java) course at Scottsdale Community College with Professor Jackson. This course provided a solid foundation in programming concepts using Java.

## Course Description

CSC 110AB - Introduction to Computer Science (Java) is a course designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of computer programming using Java as the primary language. The course covers various topics, including problem-solving, algorithm development, basic data structures, and object-oriented programming concepts. Students learn how to write, test, and debug Java programs and gain experience working with real-world programming scenarios.

Throughout the course, students are exposed to a wide range of programming concepts and are encouraged to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are essential for success in the field of computer science.

## Concepts Covered

- Variables and assignments
- Branches (if statements, switch statements)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Arrays and ArrayLists
- User-defined methods
- Objects and classes
- Memory management
- And more
Throughout the course, I extensively used [ZyBooks](https://www.zybooks.com/) for learning materials and project assignments.

## Course Materials

The course materials are organized in the following manner:

- `Labs`: Contains lab assignments and exercises.
- `Projects`: Contains larger projects completed during the course.
- `Demos`: Contains code snippets and demonstrations used for learning specific concepts.

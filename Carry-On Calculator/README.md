# Carry-On Calculator

A Java program that calculates the total cost of a plane ticket based on the passenger's age, checked bags, and carry-on items.

## Description

The Carry-On Calculator takes the passenger's age, number of checked bags, and number of carry-on items as inputs, and then calculates the total cost of the plane ticket. The base ticket price is $300 for regular passengers, free for passengers aged 2 or younger, and $290 for passengers aged 60 or older. Each checked bag costs $10, and each additional carry-on item beyond the first one costs $50.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java program (e.g., javac Main.java).
2. Run the compiled Java program (e.g., java Main).
3. Follow the prompts to enter the passenger's age, number of checked bags, and number of carry-on items.
4. The program will output the total cost of the plane ticket.

```plaintext
> java Main
Age: 35
Bags: 2
Carry Ons: 3
Your total cost is: $385
```
In this example, the passenger is 35 years old, has 2 checked bags, and 3 carry-on items. The base ticket price is $300, the checked bags cost $20, and the additional carry-on item costs $50. The total cost is $385.
